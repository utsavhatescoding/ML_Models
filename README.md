2 - Problem Statement

Suppose you are the CEO of a restaurant franchise and are considering different cities for opening a new outlet.

You would like to expand your business to cities that may give your restaurant higher profits.
The chain already has restaurants in various cities and you have data for profits and populations from the cities.
You also have data on cities that are candidates for a new restaurant.
For these cities, you have the city population.
Can you use the data to help you identify which cities may potentially give your business higher profits?


We will use the data for informed decision making.
